## My custom post types

Hi!

My custom post type attempts to solve a simple task: create custom post types. It is a well known fact that one can use CPT UI in order to achieve cpts. However, this plugin is not aimed at the ones who find CPTUI useful. My custom post types focus is WordPress developers.

### Usage

The only files you need to change in order to create your cpts lives in src/theposttypes. Inside this folder, you will find an example file, named example.php. To create a new post type just copy this file over as many times you want. In each file you only need to change two variables $Name and $Plural to whatever you want.
